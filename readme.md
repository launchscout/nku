The majority of your grade will come from class assignments and projects.

  * 10% - Your communication and problem solving to get the assignment done and learn the material
    * Github issues
    * In class participation
    * Helping other classmates on a Github issue
  * 30% - Our subjective assessment of how maintainable your code is:
    * Does it follow the conventions that we've discussed in class?
    * Is the code in the right place?
    * Are there tests that would help someone understand and work on your project?
    * Can we easily follow your process through git history?
  * Possible in-class quizzes will be added in
  * If you do a great job helping someone on a Github issue we're likely to give you a bonus
